# This is My OWN shell program!!!

i started creating this shell program
and use my compiler skills to create this.

## FEATURES
- it has variable storage
- prompt commands
- advanced parsing
- decent error handling
- mathematical operations


### bash commands like
1. cp
2. cd
3. rm
4. whoami

END MUCH MORE

---

The whoami command is only for extra functionality
it dosent work correctly, so that mean that you dont 
create accounts with commands but you have to change 
the top macros on main.c.

Its going to get a modular disign and more 
functionality in the future.

---

## EXECUTE AND RUN
type the commands
```bash
make
make run
```
to compile and run the program.

---

To delete the executables run
```bash
make clean
```
